# Solar Energy Forecast

This is The Final Project of Infnet Institute Bootcamp in Data Science, Analytics and Machine Learning.

In this Project we focused on the production of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and Thermal Energy using 2010-2018 data to predict Solar Power energy by 2020.

The data was collected through the California ISO Reports. It was performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used the Facebook Prophet Algorithm to create the model forecast.

Enjoy the full Presentation to know the path and understand the amazing Universe of Solar Forecast!
